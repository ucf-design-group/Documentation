title: MySQL Setup and Usage
description: This describes the steps that were taken to set up MySQL, and how you can manage it manually if needed.
---

**Purpose**: MySQL, like any other piece of software, requires setup and periodic maintenance. This will hopefully make that less scary.

**Background**: MySQL is a package like any other piece of software you might install on a Linux machine. By default, you manage MySQL via the terminal. Tools like PHPMyAdmin make things easier, but they aren't always an option.

### Initial Setup

Setup begins with installing the `mysql-server` package:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
{% endhighlight %}

During the installation process, it will ask you to make a password for the root MySQL user. It is **extremely important** that you record this somewhere. When all else fails, you'll need to access MySQL using its root account.

Now, let's log in using that root account. The following logs into the MySQL console as user `root` and asks for a password in the process.

{% highlight bash %}
mysql -u root -p
{% endhighlight %}

Once you log in, you're in MySQL. Instead of terminal commands, now you can enter MySQL statements just like the ones you'd find embedded in PHP code.

In general, it isn't good to regularly use the root user. Let's create another user for our purposes:

{% highlight bash %}
create user 'osi-admin'@'localhost' identified by '<Insert Password>';
grant all privileges on *.* to 'osi-admin'@'localhost' with grant option;
exit
{% endhighlight %}

---

### Managing via Terminal

The best way to access MySQL is to SSH to its host machine and then run:

{% highlight bash %}
mysql -u osi-admin -p
{% endhighlight %}

The `-u` flag states which user to log in as, and `-p` tells it to ask for a password (sometimes, accounts are setup without password authentication). When you do so, you enter the MySQL console.

Within the console, you can run any MySQL statement. [Online documentation](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/) is the best place to go for more information about the syntax.

Here are some common things you might want to do:

* `show databases;` shows a list of available databases. Note that you'll only see databases you have permission to use.
* `use <Database Name>;` makes the given database the focus of your commands.
* `show tables;` shows the tables in the current database.
* `select * from <Table Name>;` dumps all of the data from a table in semi-tabular format.

Random piece of advice: When you delete or update a record, please type the "where" clause first. If you forget to type the "where" clause, you may accidentally delete or update all of the records in the given table. There was once a hashtag trending on Twitter of "five word tech horrors" - "I forgot the where clause" was one of the more popular ones.

### Backup and Restore

For backing up a MySQL database, there's a separate command you can use: `mysqldump`. Here's the basic usage:

{% highlight bash %}
mysqldump <Database Name> -u osi-admin -p > <Output File>
{% endhighlight %}

This will give you a file with all of the SQL statements necessary to rebuild the given database from scratch. It is a great way to both back up and transfer the database.

To restore a database from such a file, you use `mysql`. Please note that this could override existing data:

{% highlight bash %}
mysql -u osi-admin -p -D <Database Name> < <Output File>
{% endhighlight %}
