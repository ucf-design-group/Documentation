title: Quick SSH
description: This will show you how to set up aliases for the machines to which you SSH most often.

**Purpose**: Typing a long SSH address, like aa123456@sdesosiwebdev1.sdes.ucf.edu, can be a pain. We can shorten it dramatically. This will show you how.

**Background**: SSH, like many programs, stores hidden files in your home directory. In fact, it has an entire directory, `~/.ssh` (note that `~` refers to your home directory). We can utilize this hidden directory and add a configuration file, `~/.ssh/config`, to suit our needs.

---

### Configuration

On the machine from which you will initiate the SSH connection (probably one of the Macs at OSI, or perhaps your personal Mac), open up a terminal and run these commands:

{% highlight bash %}
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
touch ~/.ssh/config
nano ~/.ssh/config
{% endhighlight %}

You are now editing your personal SSH configuration file. In here, let's add a predefined host. The following example creates predefined hosts for the OSI dev and live servers.

{% highlight bash %}
Host osi-dev
	HostName sdesosiwebdev1.sdes.ucf.edu
	User <Your NID>
	
Host osi-web
	HostName sdesosiweb1.sdes.ucf.edu
	User <Your NID>
{% endhighlight %}

Use `ctrl+O` to save and `ctrl+X` to exit nano. Now you can type `ssh osi-dev` and `ssh osi-web` to SSH into the OSI servers.
