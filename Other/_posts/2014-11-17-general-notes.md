title: General Notes for OSI Web Position
description: This will provide extra little details that can make your time at OSI a bit easier.
---

**Purpose**: OSI Web is a vital position within the Office of Student Involvement. These notes will help you stay organized and focused throughout your time here at OSI. Below is a list (in no particular order) of OSI Web responsibilities and some tips to help you accomplish them.

### Organization

Web developers are constantly dealing with multiple files from multiple people. It's important to keep them stored in a fashion such that they do not get lost or deleted.

The OSI Web Mac Mini's have several places that we use to access our files. They are as follows:

* Locally (Used for temporarily storing files and developing)
* OSI Graphics (Shared Drive with other designers)
    - We mainly use 2 folders on this drive (Web and Web Dropbox. Web stores all of our assets and documentation/notes used to create sites. Web Dropbox is the folder used to get documents from Designers such as OSI Web Banners)
* OSI-Dev (Dev/Testing Server)
* OSI-Web (Live Web Server)

All of these drives are automatically mounted via Samba on the Mac during login with an applescript. You should have the previous employee help you get your account setup and access to the drive before you start.

### Applications

Feel free to store which applications you feel you may need on the Mac minis as you should have admin rights. Some of the core applications we use are as follows:

* Sublime Text 2
* Mou
* Photoshop/Illustrator
* Codekit (compiles Sass)
* Alfred (Alternative to spotlight)
* Transmit (FTP)
* Multiple browsers for testing (Chrome, Firefox, Firefox Developer, Safari)


Some of these applications are free to use and some aren't If you do decide to use a personal application key on an application be sure to remove it once you retire from the position. Please be sure to maintain applications and keep them updated or remove them if they are no longer being used. This is in the best interest of the Mac to prevent sluggishness.

### Mac Maintenance

The Mac Minis that OSI web has were a special PRF that we were granted. That being said SDES is not in charge of maintaining them, we are. We recommend reformatting the macs every 1-2 years to keep them fresh for the next user. You should also maintain performing security and OS updates as they are released. 

One quick update that can be done via the terminal to keep some of our dependencies and applications up to date is `brew update` then `brew upgrade`.

### Email (osiweb@ucf.edu)

Email is our main form of communication with our supervisors and the agencies within OSI. 

* The Email password must be changed every few months, you will receive an email reminding you it needs to be changed. If it is not changed in time you will have to consult your supervisor to get the password reset. It can be changed via the <a href="https://webmail.ucf.edu/CookieAuth.dll?GetLogon?curl=Z2Fowa&reason=0&formdir=1">webmail</a>.
* Please remember to always CC the Graduate Assistant and Design Group Coordinator on all emails to agencies.
* Try to set up a signature, osiweb@ucf.edu will be used by multiple web developers and it helps to have a signature so that the person on the receiving end knows exactly who they are talking with.

### Github

OSI Web keeps all of our websites on Github. Github is a website used to store code repositories. You can use GIT (A version control system) to collaborate and make changes to these existing code repositories.

If you are unfamiliar with Git Codeschool offers a quick <a href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">Crash Course</a>.

You can make a personal Github account to start contributing to any and all repos available. Once you have that setup you gain access to OSI Web's Github group so that you can contribute directly to our repos instead of having to make pull requests. Using Git and Github while at OSI has a ton of upsides including:

* Having a backed up version of all your work at all times
* Git is a technology used in the web field very commonly so its good to know.
* You have a place where all of your work that you've ever done at OSI is stored and can be shown off to potential future employers.
* Most of the older OSI Web developers stay in the group and can still contribute to the new repos that are being created daily.

### Google Analytics

OSI Web has a Google Analytics account with all of the current WordPress sites being tracked. This information has been extremely valuable in the past as it helps us explain to higher ups reasoning behind decisions on how we run and maintain our websites. You can also use this analytic data to help improve the websites that you maintain.

Please be sure to add any websites to the google analytics as new ones are created. The login information for the analytics can be found in our passwords document. Once logged in access the Admin panel and create a new property. Fill out the required information and get the UA Tracking code. You can then implement the tracking code via the OSI Analytics WordPress Plugin we've created. If you are not using WordPress then just copy the script that Google provides and add it to your site.

### PRFs (Purchase Request Forms)

PRFs are how that you or any other designer can order special accommodations or items that will help you better your work and your work environment. In the past we have ordered things like Mac Mini's and applications like Codekit or Adobe Creative Cloud. 

In order to input a PRF you must take the financial training course on WebCourses once per year. Your supervisor will likely remind you to do this.

Please document all of your PRF's so that we have a record of previous purchases or in case a product needs to be renewed.

### Working With Agencies

Agencies are very much like real life clients. Working in OSI provides a great environment to learn how to work with clients. The agencies have several website needs and rely on you to maintain and create websites to support these needs.

 Agencies are usually very cooperative, but not all of them are web experts. Use your best judgement when working with agencies in order to provide the best possible outcome for both parties. Sometimes they may ask you to do something you necessarily do not know how to do. Try to keep an open mind and see if you can work with them to get an outcome that everyone is happy with.

### Work Timeline

Unlike the graphic designers we do not have a quick turnover rate on projects. OSI Web is generally in charge of maintaining our existing websites with small updates/features while still working on an overall big picture timeline of creating new content/websites/projects for the agencies. It is important to keep the websites maintained and be to be easily accessible to agencies for short and quick updates while still keeping a timeline of projects that you are currently working on or plan on working on. 

This timeline can usually be discussed with your Coordinator so you have a plan for the current/future semesters.

### Weekly Web Meetings

 Meeting with your coworkers, GA, and Coordinator each week is a great way to stay on top of what you and the rest of OSI Web is currently working on. At these meetings you can bring up any communication issues that may be occurring with agencies as well as talk about progress that has been made on both short/long term tasks.
